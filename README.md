# Pharmacy-Pricing Plot1

Here I tried to display the change of price for one random drug, oxycodone HCl. By selecting information of certain drug through NDC, making the price correspond to the date and sorting by date, I got the information needed to plot the price change of one certain drug. In general, the price dropped from 2016. Another interesting thing is the fluctuation in 2018.
