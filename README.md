# Pharmacy-Pricing

Here I found two similar drugs. Their first 9 digits of NCD are the same, which means their productor, specific strength, dosage form (i.e, capsule, tablet, liquid) and formulation are the same. The only different is the size of bottle. Since the price is normalized, itâ€™s interesting to see that the same kind of drug has different prices with different sizes. Also, the one with higher price has no data after March 2015, maybe because its high price.
